  <div class = user-description> <p>I feel like I was chosen. Baxter chose me. Baxter was beaten and abused in a low-income part of Denver frequented by gangs. He was an abandoned stray. At 6 months old he only weighed 24 pounds. Now he’s 72. I got him at a shelter. I didn’t think he was going to make it. I told the shelter people: ‘I’m taking him.’ It’s what I do. At first I would turn on the radio and he would freak out. It took me two years to get him medically and emotionally well.</p>
  <p>Once, Baxter had nothing. Now, he has everything. “He’s legally the CEO of my foundation, which is named after Wags and Menace, two abused dogs I had. Baxter and I cover 1,000 miles in Colorado, visiting shelters, Boys and Girls Clubs, Boy Scout and Girl Scout groups. We volunteer, raise money and teach. It’s my calling.</p>
